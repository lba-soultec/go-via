<h1> Howto use VIA </h1>

<h2> Creating </h2>

<h3> Create a pool </h3>
First, create a pool of ips. Hosts will be able to request these ips via DHCP when you allow them to be re-imaged. If a host is not set to be re-imaged, the DHCP server will refuse to hand out addresses.

<h3> Upload a ESXi ISO Image </h3>
Second step is to upload an ESXi ISO. No other operating systems are currently supported since a lot of background crunching is done to ensure that files are in the right place,and that the boot.cfg and ks.cfg files look correct. Custom ISOs however with custom drivers etc shouldn't be a problem as long as they look similar to official builds.

<h3> Create a group </h3>
The group you create will have all the common configuration parameters for your hosts. e.g. ntp, dns, initial deployment password, ks config etc.
When you've created a group, start adding hosts to it.
If you want to change something in the future, it's now very easy to just change this on the group level, instead of having to modify every single host.
<br/>
Options:<br/>
- Boot Device: If you don't specify a boot device --firstdisk is used. If you're server doesn't comply with this, you can manually specify the mpx device to be uesd.<br/>
- DNS Suffix: Will configure the dns suffix for the host. If you enter the FQDN of sfo-m01-esx01.rainpole.io , the suffix is rainpole.io.<br/>
- SSH: Will enable the service SSH on the host, and silence the warning that ssh is enabled on the host.<br/>
- NTP: Will configure the NTP settings enterd on the host.<br/>
- (WARNING) Erase all disks: During deployment, this will erase all data and partitions on all disks connected to the host. This includes all LUNs that may be masked to the host!<br/>

<h3> Start imaging </h3>
To initiate a host imaging/re-imaging, simply press the re-image button next to the host, and reboot it. If the host is configured to network boot, the DHCP server will now offer the host an ip-address, and boot options to allow the host to perform a fully unattended deployment.
When the host has been fully imaged, the DHCP server will set the host object to not be imaged again, this ensures that you dont accidentally re-image your hosts, or get stuck in an image loop.

<h2> Editing </h2>

<h3> Edit a pool </h3>
To edit a pool, simply click Edit Scope next to the scope you wish to edit.

<h3> Edit a Group </h3>
To edit a group, click Edit Group below the group.

<h2> Deleting </h2>

<h3> Deleting pools </h3>
To delete a pool, ensure that no groups or hosts are using the pool first

<h3> Deleting Images </h3>
To delete an image, edit each group and select another image first, when no groups are using the image you can remove the image.

<h3> Deleting Groups </h3>
To delete a group, first remove all the hosts in the group.

<h3> Deleting hosts </h3>
To remove a host, simply click remove next to the host and it will be removed.

<h3> Starting over </h3> 
To start over, simply remove the sqlite-database.db file, when you start the application it will detect if the database is present, if it's not it will create it.

<h3> configuration file </h3>
You can select what interface to listen to in the configuration file.

<h3> custom kickstart file </h3>
this is being worked on, you will be able to override kickstart at the levels of: Group -> Host

<h3> HTTP-REST </h3>
Everything is called via HTTP-REST, for documentation go to "/swagger"
